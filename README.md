# cpp-headers

A collection of my general-purpose C++ classes. This is some way short of a
library, but all the classes contained within are intended to be standalone
and provide recognisable interfaces in keeping with the CSL.

Currently all of these are implemented as pure headers (hence the repository
name) which makes them lighter weight, easier to use and (frankly) easier to
distribute. I may add fully fledged classes at a later point if necessary, but
for now this repository is limited to very simple, robust building blocks
designed to be performant and easier to integrate than a giant library such as
boost.
